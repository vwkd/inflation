/**
 * Inflation calculator
 *
 * ## Features
 *
 * - convert amount across years
 * - support both directions, old to new or new to old
 * - support currency replacements
 * - has built-in data sets
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Inflation } from "@vwkd/inflation";
 * import { currencyReplacements, inflationRates } from "@vwkd/inflation/de";
 *
 * const inflationDe = new Inflation(inflationRates, currencyReplacements);
 *
 * const nominalAmount = 100;
 * const fromYear = 1999;
 * const toYear = 2023;
 * const realAmount = inflationDe.adjust(nominalAmount, fromYear, toYear);
 *
 * console.log(realAmount); // 79.96
 * ```
 *
